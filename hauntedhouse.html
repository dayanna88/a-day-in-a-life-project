<h1>Haunted House</h1>

<p>At night, we decided to go to a haunted  house<br>
  in the military base at Virginia.
  We both were <br> excited and curious  about this
  house because it was <br> going to be my
  first time going to one <br>and my boyfriend hadnâ€™t
  gone to one since he  was a chid.  </p>

<p>We had a different kind of fun at this house,<br>
  we were scared but at the same time enjoying<br>
  the moment. It was like we were in many horror<br>
  movies at the same place. Movies like The Nun,<br>
  The Ring, The Purge, and Hostel were represented<br>
  in a creative, believable, and creepy way. </p>
