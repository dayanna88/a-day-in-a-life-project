<h1>Open House</h1>

<p>I went to an open house with my boyfriend in Bethesda,MD<br>
to visit my sister who was in charge of welcoming the visitors.<br>
It was my first time going to an open house. <br> I met the architect
who redesigned the house.<br> We took a tour around the house <br> and
the thing that caught most my attention was <br>this painting that
was hanging in one of the rooms. </p>
